**Dynamic pathway linking Pakistan flooding to East Asia heatwaves**

In Julyâ€“August 2022, Pakistan suffered historic flooding while record-breaking heatwaves swept southern China, 
causing severe socio-economic impacts. Similar extreme events have frequently coincided between two regions during 
the past 44 years, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use observations and a suite of model experiments 
to show that the upper-tropospheric divergent wind induced by convective heating over Pakistan excites a stationary 
anomalous anti-cyclone over eastern China, which further leads to persistent heatwaves. Atmospheric model ensemble 
simulation further indicates that this dynamic pathway linking Pakistan flooding and East Asia heatwaves is intrinsic 
to the climate system, largely independent of global sea surface temperature forcing. This dynamic connection via the 
upper troposphere westerly waveguide is robust, offering hopes to improve the sub-seasonal prediction of extreme events 
in East Asia.
