**Dynamic pathway linking Pakistan flooding to East Asia heatwaves**

In Julyâ€“August 2022, Pakistan suffered historic flooding while record-breaking heatwaves swept southern China, 
causing severe socio-economic impacts. Similar extreme events have frequently coincided between two regions during 
the past 44 years, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use observations and a suite of model experiments 
to show that the upper-tropospheric divergent wind induced by convective heating over Pakistan excites a stationary 
anomalous anti-cyclone over eastern China, which further leads to persistent heatwaves. Atmospheric model ensemble 
simulation further indicates that this dynamic pathway linking Pakistan flooding and East Asia heatwaves is intrinsic 
to the climate system, largely independent of global sea surface temperature forcing. This dynamic connection via the 
upper troposphere westerly waveguide is robust, offering hopes to improve the sub-seasonal prediction of extreme events 
in East Asia.

**Multiple Tropical Cyclone Events in the Northern Hemisphere: Mechanisms, Projections, and Statistic Model**

Multiple tropical cyclone events (MTCEs) could exacerbate natural hazards, and are important but difficult for prediction. Understanding the mechanism and potential changes in MTCE under a warmer climate are crucial for effective risk management and ensuring human safety, however, it remains tricky. Based on an objective method called K-means, this study first explores the corresponding large-scale environment and dynamic conditions of three clustered types of MTCEs over the western North Pacific (WNP) and North Atlantic (NA). Furthermore, we project changes in MTCEs by 2050 in the major basins of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) using high-resolution climate models. Results show that a significant increase in the frequency and duration of MTCEs over the NA is tied to vertical wind shear, and a notable decrease over the WNP is attributed to mid-level vertical motion. These findings give a first understanding of future changes in MTCEs and give implications for disaster mitigation and prevention among countries in the NH. To further facilitate the understanding between MTCE change and TC genesis frequency and seasonality, we propose a Poisson-Gamma landfall model. This part of research is ongoing...
