I am a first year Ph.D. student in [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://atmsci.fudan.edu.cn), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn) co-advised by [Prof. Wen Zhou](https://atmsci.fudan.edu.cn/97/c3/c14809a432067/page.htm) and [Prof. Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) (in [Scripps](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/)). 

Prior to my graduate study, I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences with [highest honor](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IrSmcYiTu8evdjnnex3WtQ) from Fudan University in June 2023. In my sophomore year, I conducted my first research project on air quality under the supervision of [Prof. Xingnan Ye](https://environment.fudan.edu.cn/5b/8b/c30977a351115/page.htm) from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University. After one year of training, I joined [Prof. Ruifen Zhan](https://atmsci.fudan.edu.cn/79/c2/c14809a162242/page.htm)’s team to investigate the multiple tropical cyclone event (MTCE) funded by the [Fudan’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (FDUROP)](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/2019/0423/c515a95967/page.htm). 

Currently, I am interested in the dynamics of extreme climate/weather events (e.g., heatwaves, floods, tropical cyclones).
