I am a first year Ph.D. student in [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://atmsci.fudan.edu.cn) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn), co-advised by [Prof. Wen Zhou](https://atmsci.fudan.edu.cn/97/c3/c14809a432067/page.htm) and [Prof. Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) (from [Scripps](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/)). 

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I graduated with [the highest honors](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IrSmcYiTu8evdjnnex3WtQ) , earning a B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from Fudan University in June 2023. During my undergraduate years, I engaged in interesting research initiatives. In my sophomore year, I conducted my first research project on air quality under the supervision of [Prof. Xingnan Ye](https://environment.fudan.edu.cn/5b/8b/c30977a351115/page.htm) from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University. After one year of training, I joined [Prof. Ruifen Zhan](https://atmsci.fudan.edu.cn/79/c2/c14809a162242/page.htm)’s team to investigate the multiple tropical cyclone events (MTCEs), supported by [Fudan’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (FDUROP)](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/2019/0423/c515a95967/page.htm). 

My current research focuses on the dynamics of extreme climate/weather events, including heatwaves, floods, and tropical cyclones.
